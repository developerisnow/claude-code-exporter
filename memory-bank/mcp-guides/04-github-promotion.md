## README Best Practices

### 1. Essential Components

#### **Project Title and Description**
- Use a clear, descriptive title that immediately conveys your MCP server's purpose
- Write a one-sentence description that explains what problem your MCP server solves
- Avoid generic titles like "My MCP Server" - be specific about functionality

#### **Problem Statement**
- Clearly articulate the **what**, **why**, and **how** of your project
- Example: "This MCP server connects Claude to your PostgreSQL database, enabling natural language queries without exposing credentials"

### 2. Structure Your README

```markdown
# MCP-[Service Name] Server

One-line description of what this MCP server does.

## 🚀 Features
- Feature 1 with benefit
- Feature 2 with benefit
- Feature 3 with benefit

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ / Python 3.10+
- [Service] account/access
- Claude Desktop app

## 🔧 Installation
Step-by-step installation guide

## 💻 Usage

```

### 3. Visual Elements

#### **Badges**
Add relevant badges to build trust:
```markdown
![MCP Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCP-1.0.0-blue)
![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/yourusername/mcp-server)
![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/yourusername/mcp-server)
![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/yourusername/mcp-server)
```

#### **Demo GIF**
Include a demo GIF showing your MCP server in action with Claude Desktop

#### **Architecture Diagram**
Use Mermaid diagrams to explain how your MCP server works:
```markdown
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Claude Desktop] --> B[MCP Server]
    B --> C[Your Service API]
    C --> D[Data/Actions]
```
```

### 4. MCP-Specific Documentation

- **Configuration Examples**: Show complete `claude_desktop_config.json` snippets
- **Available Tools**: List all tools/resources your server exposes
- **Error Handling**: Document common errors and solutions
- **Security Notes**: Explain how credentials are handled

## Getting Featured in Awesome Lists
